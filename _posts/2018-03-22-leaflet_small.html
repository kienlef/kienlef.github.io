According to The Economist Magazine, data has replaced oil as the world s most valuable resource.   Ascension Analytics Group specializes in helping your business utilize and understand its most powerful resource.  </br></br>Advanced econometric analysis and data analytics are extremely powerful tools that can often lead to competitive advantages not available to businesses in the past. However, when applied incorrectly, these techniques can lead to poor and misleading conclusions.  Most companies have some level of information technology staffing well qualified to collect data, provide basic reports, and perform basic spreadsheet analytics.  However, extracting the most valuable nuggets of business intelligence from these heaps of data requires expertise beyond what a typical IT department can provide. Ascension Analytics finds that companies are sitting on mountains of relevant data, but they lack expertise to distill it into valuable nuggets of business intelligence. </br></br>The business world is changing at speeds not seen since the Industrial Revolution. Data driven solutions are without question the key to survival in today s fast paced economy. Ascension Analytics was formed to help businesses harness this power.

It is central to the economics of traffic, demand and conversion. Management of growth rests on a quantitative understanding of user lifecycles, attrition and lifetime values. Companies rely on data-centric solutions for growing traffic, improving the returns from the traffic via conversion and monetization, and instrumentation/testing/analysis to fine-tune the user experience. In commerce-centric businesses, Data Science is also critical to inventory planning, resource allocation, routing, facility location and other areas of optimization.</br></br>At Short Proof, we offer end-to-end Data Science capabilities to companies in the consumer internet sector. We bring together extensive domain knowledge and experience; cross-functional capabilities that span analysis, research, engineering, product management and leadership; and expertise in a range of areas such as targeting and relevance, marketing optimization, advertising and ad networks, monetization models, sponsored search; user interface optimization, A/B testing and data frameworks for the consumer web, and optimization of supply chains and operations. </br></br>The Short Proof difference:</br></br>-- A nuanced quantitative understanding of complex user lifecycles and the relationship between user experience on one hand and lifecycle parameters such as attrition and lifetime value on the other. That understanding drives product decisions and prioritization, and it also powers the optimization of user acquisition machinery.</br>-- Sophisticated growth management models link user acquisition and spend optimization, lifetime value models, attrition prediction, re-engagement and incentive programs</br>-- Business model optimization, including keeping a tab on the pulse of a young user base and evolving user behaviors, and tweaking the relationship with the user to take advantage of discovered patterns and sidestep threats and risks. </br></p></div>')[0];

Combining the rigor of scientific research with the impact of effective policy, the scientists working at CWC aim to design research-based, reliable, and sustainable models of water management and development that can be implemented on local, regional and global levels. The Columbia Water Center (CWC), in collaboration with other Earth Institute units and external partners, is leading intellectual inquiry into the assessment, understanding and resolution of the global crisis of freshwater scarcity.</br></br>Five themes guide our work in 2017/2018:</br></br>- America s Water: America s water security faces increasing pressures on multiple fronts. Through radical</br>technical innovations and superior management of water systems, CWC provides global leadership in</br>the design of 21st century cities and the structures and management of watercourses for the public</br>good.</br></br>- Data Science and Multi-Scale Predictions: Successful adaptation to climate change and variability</br>requires an understanding of climate scenarios that accurately represent weather-related uncertainties.</br>CWC researchers are leading innovation in developing novel data-based methods for risk prediction and</br>assessment. Risk management strategists, corporate supply chain managers, and city and national</br>planners tangibly benefit from these methods in their work.</br></br>- The Columbia Global Floods Initiative: Today floods are the world s most prevalent natural disaster and a</br>major contributor to the average annual loss of life and property. CWC uses a comprehensive approach</br>to minimize extreme flooding impacts by integrating short- to long-term climate forecasting, reservoir</br>and operations design, and land use considerations. To mitigate the effects of extreme floods, CWC</br>researchers are identifying supply-chain vulnerabilities, examining disaster preparedness and response,</br>and creating new insurance and other financial instruments.</br></br>- Risk and Financial Instruments: Supply chains depend on both resources and transportation that are</br>subject to challenging conditions such as floods, droughts, earthquakes, and oil spills. CWC researchers</br>are mapping supply-chain exposure pathways and environmental disaster clusters to identify impacts on</br>different sections of the supply chains. Our researchers are developing novel regional financial risk</br>management products to provide businesses, governments and other institutions with the necessary</br>tools to mitigate supply-chain risks.</br></br>- Water/Food/Energy Nexus: Food and energy production inextricably intertwine with water resources.</br>The largest uses of freshwater are agricultural irrigation, energy extractions, and the thermal cooling of</br>energy-producing power plants. CWC researchers study how the water, food, and energy sectors are</br>interrelated and how climate affects this dynamic. These analyses help guide sustainable regional</br>development, informing agriculture decisions based on water, soil, climate, and the proximity to major</br>demand centers.</br></br>In addition to research, the Water Center both sponsors a seminar series featuring talks on water-related issues, and develops educational opportunities, such as an internship program and water-related courses and certifications at Columbia.</p></div>')[0];

Data Center Knowledge reports that human error has surpassed equipment failure as the single largest cause of service interruptions. </br></br>Very recently, a new term has emerged, the "Digital Supply Chain." This refers to the thousands of software, infrastructure and platform as a service providers, as well as hundreds of other on-demand micro services used by digital products and connected devices. Every connected device from your Uber app to the cash register at Starbucks relies on several components of the digital supply chain.</br></br>Offline supply chains, like that of auto manufacturing, have had decades to turn the logistics of a complicated supply chain into a science with mature software automation and a robust backchannel to communicate changes and issues. The digital supply chain is still very young, with no automation and an error-prone backchannel thats the leading cause of the human error factor in downtime.</br></br>GapGrid, Inc. is building the automation the digital supply chain desperately needs. As the "Internet of Things" rises in dominance, and enterprises everywhere are moving to the cloud, the industry needs a reliable and frictionless way to remove the human error as a cause of downtime. GapGrid seeks to be that way.</p></div>')[0];
