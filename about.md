### Author
Currently I am responsible for artificial intelligence and  data scientist at Camelot ITLab GmbH in Germany

Before that I was working 5 years at Blue Yonder GmbH as a developer, product manager and consultant.

As a data scientist my major work comprises the question:
‘How to add value to companies asset type data?’
Answering this question is more than statistical data algorithms or the technical programming. It is the art to integrate data driven design principles within the complex world of large scale enterprises.


Until 2012 I was Akademischer Rat at the Technical University of Kaiserslautern with three major activities:
lectures, project management, and guidance of Phd candidates.
