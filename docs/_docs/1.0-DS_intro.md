### Core topics in the lecture
I experience over and over again big 3 mistakes when designing statistical / machine learning models for data-driven enterprises.

* not knowing the business value and definition of good
* selecting wrong or biased information
* designing models which are too complex and costly to maintain

Thus the lecture is focusing on:
* the business value of good decisions and how to link to the statistical world
* selecting correct data sets and what is a good metric to measure
* data driven models can be derived in a systematic way, focus should be maintainability and link to value
