There are often different definitions for the terms, here, the definitions used as consequent as possible throughout this play-book.

Cognitive Bias
: is a repeating or basic misstep in thinking and decision making. You belief and decide in favor for what you like to be true rather what is true.

Statistical bias
: is a systematic tendency in the process of data collection or calculation mistake which leads in distorted results.

Big Data
: represents the information assets characterized by a high volume, velocity and variety to require specific technology and analytical methods for its transformation into value.

Data Science
: Data science is the art of delivering value through data. A practice which unifies elements of three domains: business understanding, mathematics and computer science.

Complex Systems
: Complex systems are living systems with many touch points with humans or environmental influences. Such systems can only externally observable and often not controllable.

Complicated Systems
: Complicated systems can be described and decomposed in logical sub-parts to diminish or reduce uncertainty as far as possible. Mostly these systems can be described in a chain of cause to effect relationships and can thus be modeled and controlled.

Intelligence
: is the ability to learn from experience, solve problems, and use knowledge to adapt to new situations.

Artificial Intelligence
: An artificial intelligence (AI) system is a collection of advanced technologies that allow machines to sense, comprehend, act, and learn.

Intelligent agents
: entities that collect information about their environment from sensors and then process this information to decide how to act back on their environment.

Verification
: ensuring that software fully satisfies all the expected requirements.

Robotic Process Automation
: RPA bots are designed to automate individual, isolated tasks within existing business processes. RPA does not address the need to optimize or redesign processes for the future world.

Taxonomy
: is the practice and science of classification. It provide machines and humans ordered, hierarchical representations of topics and their properties within a particular domain.  

Ontology
: represents entities, ideas, and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories.
In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains.


Semantic Web
: provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.

Perception
: is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented information, or the environment.

Reasoning
: is the capability for making sense of things, establishing and verifying facts, applying logic, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information.

Hedonic treadmill
: the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.

Effective and Efficiency
: effective is doing the right things. Efficiency is doing the things right.

Framework
: framework describes a common practice for creating, interpreting, analyzing and using descriptions within a particular domain of interest. Or in short a logical structure for classifying and organizing complex information.

Methodology
: documented approach for performing activities in a coherent, consistent, accountable, and repeatable manner.

Process
: a (business) process is defined as patterns of interaction, coordination, communication, and decision making employees use to transform resources into products and services of greater worth.

Design Pattern
: It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the data scientist can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Knowledge Management (KM)
: is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organization.

Expert System
: is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert mainly realized via as ifâ€“this-then-that rules.

Data Flow
: programming is a programming paradigm that models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing data flow principles and architecture.

Pipeline ML
: a pipeline in machine learning is used to concatenate individual processing steps. It is a divide and conquer method to solve a larger problem by solving smaller fragments separately by using individual machine learning models.

Buzzword
: is a word or phrase used continuously due to its popularity or marketing usage.  Buzzwords are often used to impress others, often detached from its original meaning.  

Best Practice
: method or technique that has been proofed to be superior to alternatives in delivering valuable results. Best practices are designed with retrospective knowledge, which implies that its adoption to a new situation should always be matched regarding a new unique situation.
