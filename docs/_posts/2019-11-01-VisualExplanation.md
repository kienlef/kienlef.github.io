Visualization techniques are of high importance in the field of data science and teaching to explain the concepts of AI.

Using charts, graphs, and animations to visualize complex topics is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports.

Here, in this article, I started to collect excellent animations explaining parts within the complex world of artificial intelligence.

For sure many good links are missing, feel free to send comments, I will update the list.

Many thanks to the original and creative authors! Great piece of work.
